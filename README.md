# Akan Name Generator

## Project Description

The **Akan Name Generator** is a web-based application that generates **Akan names** based on the user’s **birthdate** and **gender**. The Akan people are an ethnic group from West Africa, and they have a tradition of giving children names based on the day of the week they were born. This project helps users learn their Akan name by entering their birthdate and gender.

### Features:
- Users input their **birthdate** and select their **gender**.
- After submitting, the application calculates the **day of the week** they were born and matches it with an **Akan name**.
- If the user doesn't enter a valid date or doesn't select a gender, the system alerts them.

## Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

### User Stories:
1. **When** a user selects their **birthdate** and **gender**, and clicks **"Get Akan Name"**, **then** the application should display their Akan name based on the day of the week they were born.
2. **When** the user enters an invalid date or fails to select a gender, **then** the application will show an **alert** instructing the user to correct their input.

### Example Scenarios:
- **Valid Input**:  
  - User enters **July 15, 1990**, and selects **Male**. The application will calculate the day of the week and return the corresponding Akan name.
  
- **Invalid Input**:  
  - User does not select a gender or provides an invalid date (e.g., **February 30**). The system will prompt an alert to notify them to correct the mistake.
